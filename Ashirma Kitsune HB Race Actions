        Once you cast charm person or invisibility with this trait, you can’t cast
        that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast
        either of those spells normally using any spell slots you have of the
        appropriate level.


        Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race). None of these spells require spell components when you cast them with this trait.

            You can transform between your true fox form and human form at will as an
            action. This ability functions as Wild Shape with the following
            exceptions:


            You may speak as normal and use Kitsune Magic while in your fox form.

            When you transform, you retain your existing hit points and damage instead of assuming the beast’s hit points.

            If you are reduced to 0 hitpoints while in your fox form you remain in that form.


            Your speed is a base of 40ft  while in True Form, and your size is considered Tiny.
