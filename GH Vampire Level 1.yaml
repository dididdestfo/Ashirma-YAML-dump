        On your turn, immediately after you take the attack action, you can use
        your bonus action to make a special unarmed bite attack. You can use
        your Dexterity modifier instead of strength to hit with this attack.
        This attack deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength or
        Dexterity modifier. The target must then succeed at a Constitution
        saving throw or take 2d6 necrotic damage. You regain hit point equal to
        the necrotic damage dealt this way. This attack generates 1 Fury Point
        as normal. If this attack reduces a humanoid creature of size Medium or
        smaller to 0 hit points, you gain 3 Fury Points instead.


        Add the Blood Fury counters with `!cc fury +<1, 3>` depending on which type of creature you hit.

        When you hit with a melee weapon attack, you may use this ability before
        damage is dealt. If you do so, you may add 1d6 of the same damage as
        your weapon to the damage result. If this ability is used, no Fury
        Points are generated for this attack.


        You can use `-amt` to use multiple calculated strikes at a time.

        When it matters, use `-dtype <weaponDamageType>` to change the damage type, using quotes for `"magical weaponDamageType"`
