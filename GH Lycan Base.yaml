                Your kindred form takes the shape of a ferocious dire wolf. While in your
                kindred form, you gain the additional features:

                • You can speak to and understand other wolves.

                • When making an attack against a creature, if an ally is within 5 feet of that creature and not incapacitated, you have advantage on that attack roll.

                • Your speed increases by 20 feet, to a maximum of 60.

            You gain the ability to transform into the animal form representative of
            your Lycanthropy type, known as your Kindred Form. You follow the
            same rules as the Hybrid Transformation feature and any feature that
            specifies the hybrid transformation, unless specified otherwise. You
            can only transform into the kindred form representative of your
            Lycanthropy. Each Kindred Form gains the following rules:

            • You cannot speak.

            • You cannot take any actions requiring hands, except your Transformation capabilities.

            • You can only use unarmed claw and bite attacks.

            • You automatically succeed at all saving throws relating to the Lust for the Hunt flaw. Other than being larger, you are indistinguishable from a regular animal of your Kindred Form.


            Use `-choice bear` or `-choice wolf` to select your form that you take on.
