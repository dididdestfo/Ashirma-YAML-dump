        As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an
        unoccupied space you can see. Immediately after using your Twilight
        Step, one creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you
        takes fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 damage).


        You can use the Twilight Step feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
